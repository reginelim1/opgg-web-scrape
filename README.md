<b> The maximum number of games that could be scraped from opgg using while-true: 500 Â±10 </b>
<br>
<br>

The ipynb file contains three parts: <br>
a. Scrape details of specific player (that has an opgg page) from opgg website and store the details in dataframe <br>
b. Some simple analysis and simple plots <br>
c. One simple machine learning method (decision tree) for predicting the status (victory or defeat) of the game, in this case, only "Ranked Solo" queue type were used. <br>

<h5>a. Web scraping </h5>
For web scraping, <b>Selenium</b> and <b>Beautiful Soup</b> were used. The data were store in form of dataframe with the help of <b>pandas</b>.

<h5>b. Simple analysis </h5>
Different plots were created, eg. <br>
- Pie Chart
- Bar chart (horizontal and vertical)
- Scatter matrix
- Scatter plot
- KDE plot
- Heatmap
- Boxplot
- Line graph
<br>
Different tables were generated using different conditions, eg. average victory and defeat time for each champion. <b>groupby</b> and <b>apply</b> were mainly involved.

<h5>c. Machine Learning</h5>
Play with simple machine learning. In this project, decision tree was involved. Two different model evaluation methods were involved: <b>train test split</b> and <b>cross validation</b>. Both generate different results.
